# TravelMate-LoginSignup


## Description

- This is specifically the login/signup javascript and handlerbars pages I made for this group project.

Travelmate is an application designed to help users search for, and save within their personal profile, activities happening in their travel destinations. They are able to see the name of the event, a photo, the venue, date, and a link for more information.

Using this application, the user will be able to organize and plan their trips more efficiently.

This project taught us about the work required to build a full-stack website, how well the project needs to be thought through, and how important communication is between all the team members in the project. The ambitious scope of this project created a lot more work than anticipated, and there were several components to the project that were not originally assigned to group members as well as some unforseen circumstances for individual members. This made it difficult to complete the project to our imagined specifications.
